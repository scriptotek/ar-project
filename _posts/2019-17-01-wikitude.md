Testing of Wikitude and development of final prototype

## Testing Wikitude as platform and fleshing out the prototype

After reviewing six different AR-platforms and testing most of them ([see here for details](https://scriptotek.github.io/ar-project/)), we decided on Wikitude and started the process of fleshing out a prototype based on the possibilities and limitations of the chosen platform.

### Initial experiences with Wikitude

We wanted to offer both *wayfinding* - locating books on the shelves in the library - and *metadata* - extending the information you can get from a book with AR.

#### Wayfinding
The first functionality we looked into when testing Wikitude was wayfinding, and with the main purpose of location books *inside* a library, we needed good support for *indoor wayfinding*.

As of 2018 the possibilties for using mobile phones for indoor wayfinding or location is unfortunately still quite limited. GPS-sattelites do not penetrate the insides of buildings and adapting wifi-networks usually yield low precision (often with error margins of several meters placing user in a different room). Solutions require specialized beacons, requiring time and resources to implement.
We wanted to see if we could offer wayfinding without the costly and time consuming alternatives, ideally only requiring a phone.

Wikitude offer three different ways of recognizing objects in the environment or the environment itself:

* Image recognition
  Image recognition recognizes specific images, signs, banners and so on in the real world.
* Object recogntion
  A video or series of pictures of a real world physical object
* Scene reconition
  Images of large (outdoor) scenes.
