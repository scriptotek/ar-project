## Testing Wikitude as platform and fleshing out the prototype

After reviewing six different AR-platforms and testing most of them ([see here for details](https://scriptotek.github.io/ar-project/)), we decided on Wikitude and started the process of fleshing out a prototype based on the possibilities and limitations of the chosen platform.

### Initial experiences with Wikitude

-Scene reconition
-Object recogntion
-Image recognition
