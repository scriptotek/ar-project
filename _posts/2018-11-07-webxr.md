Local test of a codelab demonstration of WebXR
<!-- more -->

We did a simple test of the capabilities of the WebXR Hit Box API by setting up a local version of this [codelab tutorial](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/ar-with-webxr/#0). If it has an error that greyes out the camera, there is a fix [here](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/ar-with-webxr/issues/8)

The local version can be found [here](https://ub-www01.uio.no/prosjekter/ar/webxr/final/).

*WARNING!* Due to the instability of both the API and Chrome's canary the code above might not work at times.

To set up your phone for testing, here are the requirements:

* Android phone with Origo 8.0 (or later).
* The [ARCore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.ar.core&hl=no) app installed 
* The [Canary](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chrome.canary) Chrome test browser app installed
* Two flags in Canary must be enabled. Open The Canary browser app, type chrome://flags in the url-field, search for webxr and set 'WebXR Device API' and 'WebXR Hit Test' to 'Enabled'.

**Files**
If you want to set up this yourself, download [this zip-file](https://scriptotek.github.io/ar-project/assets/webxr.zip). The working version will be in the 'final'-folder. This will include the fix for the greying of the camera.
