Description and practical use of the final application in the library
<!-- more -->

## The physical items used in the app
We photographed the covers of four books, and we created three location targets for three collections

### The books
The books we chose were popular books spanning three different collection sharing at least one subject headings.

![All books used in app](https://scriptotek.github.io/ar-project/assets/all_covers.png "All books used in app")

These books are:
Title | Author | Collection | Subject headings
------ | ------ | ---------- | ----------------
Sapiens | Yuval Noah Harari | 42 Collection | Human evolution, Society, Human behavior
Homo Deus | Yuval Noah Harari | 42 Collection | Futurology, Society, Human behavior
Brave New World | Aldous Huxley | Scifi Collection | Futurology, Society, Human behavior
Human Biology | Sara Stinson *et al.* (editors) | Main Book Collection|Human evolution, Human genetics, Human biology

## Overview of app functionality

The main functionality of the app is to give the user:

1. AR Collection information:
   1. Discription of collection
   2. Wayfinding to collection of interest
   3. Shelf location of book of interest
2. AR Book information:
   1. Sleeve description
   2. Related books - similar books that share at least one subject heading
   3. More books - more books from same author
   4. Video (local or from Youtube)
   5. Wikipedia 

The normal expected procedure of using the app is as follows:

1. User gets information about the collection from an AR Light House:
![Get info about collection](https://scriptotek.github.io/ar-project/assets/app_desc_1.png "Scans AR Light House to get info about collection")

![Get info about collection](https://scriptotek.github.io/ar-project/assets/app_desc_2.png "Finds and scans book for metadata related to book")
![Get info about collection](https://scriptotek.github.io/ar-project/assets/app_desc_3.png "Gets waypoint for book located in another collection")
![Get info about collection](https://scriptotek.github.io/ar-project/assets/app_desc_4.png "Gets shelf location of book")

## Demonstration video
We have a [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSfdG_45iqA) demonstrating actual use of the prototype.
