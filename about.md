Augmented reality (AR) is about freeing digital information from the screen and spreading it out in the physical world. The technology is still in its early stages, with big and cluncy hardware and software that still leaves much to be desired, but development is moving fast and with backing from companies like Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon, we think the future is going to be augmented.

The goal of this project is to find out how libraries can use AR to give better service to patrons. 

We have also made a short [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TlSncJ6biY) to visualize how we imagine AR could be used in the future library. In this video we make the assumption that AR will be provided through specialized glasses. If this happens, it is still quite far in the future. Therefore, on these pages we have focused on mobile AR. 

Please, feel free to contact us if you have questions or comments. 

The project is funded by the Norwegian National Library
