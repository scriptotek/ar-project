The Library AR Project is a collaborative effort from Mandal public library and Oslo Science Library to find practical application for Augmented Reality usage in a library and see which current avialable platforms are suitable. If it is practically feasible, we will develop a prototype app with real life usability.

You can read more about the project in the [About](https://scriptotek.github.io/ar-project/about/) section.

# Testing of different platforms
As of October 2018, there are many available platforms, but not all are as suitable for AR development in a library setting.

## Criteria for choice of platform
The main criteria we use to evaulate the different platforms are:

* Functionality
* Accessibility
* Ease of implementation
* Price

**Functionality**
We see *wayfinding* and *metadata* as the main areas of functionality for AR in a library setting.

**Accessibility**
AR in a public library setting should be easily accessible on many devices. We look both at mobile app based solutions as well as browser integrated solutions.

**Ease of implementation**
Since development is local, the ease of which the different applications can be tested and turned into a workable prototype app is important

**Price**
The Library AR Project will only implement solutions that either offer possibilities of free trials (for off-the-shelf applications) or is free open source. We document the different pricing (or lack of) and evaluate the gains from the pricing.

## Specific platforms tested

### AR.js

**Benefits**
* Can be directly implemented in browser
* Works on any phone
