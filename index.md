# The project

*The Library AR Project* is a collaborative effort from Mandal public library and Oslo Science Library to find practical application for Augmented Reality (AR) usage in a library and see which current available platforms are suitable. Also a protoype using the chosen platform will be developed for testing. 

The two functionalities we want this prototype to have are:
* Wayfinding (locating books in the library)
* Eextra information on books (metadata)

We are using mobile phones as physical units (rather than eyeglasses or head mounted displays) because we see this as more practical and available at the moment (late 2018).
