The Library AR Project is a collaborative effort from Mandal public library and Oslo Science Library to find practical application for Augmented Reality usage in a library and see which current avialable platforms are suitable.
You can read more about the project in the [About](https://scriptotek.github.io/ar-project/about/) section.

- **Testing of different platforms**

As of october 2018, there are many available platforms, but not all are as suitable for AR development in a library setting.
  

- **Blog**

  [There's a blog](/blog/) too, albeit not often updated. Anything you want to write about?
